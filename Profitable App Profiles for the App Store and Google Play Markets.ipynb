The function creates a new entry in the dictionary for each new value it encounters in that column and gives it an initial count of 1. If the column value it encounters already exists as a key in the dictionary, it instead increments the count by 1.

I will not be able to calculate an average number of installs for each genre of app unless the number of installs is able to be converted to a float or integer type. Therefore, I will replace any + signs or commas with a blank character, thereby deleting any + signs or commas.

    "Overall, the data sets appear to show that a good potential market opportunity to create a free app with ad-generated revenue is in the Social Networking or Communications areas. These apps are able to generate a large number of users, even though there is already a large market presence, due to the variety of different niches that are able to be explored. One option is to create a social networking app that is geared towards a certain subset of people - for instance, football fans - that provides content and interaction with other fans that they are not able to get on any other platform. There are numerous hobbies, groups of people with medical conditions, and other shared areas of interest that do not yet have a social platform to connect those people."
